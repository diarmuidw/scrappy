Scrappy
=======
This is a simple bookmarking engine for mynown stuff. It worked OK but needs alot more to it to make it searchable/functional.

The idea was to make it suyper quick to bookmark sites but also to scrape text from a page or an image. The website would then allow you to see all teh "scraps"in a twitter like stream. 
When I use the web I open alot of pages and if I am searching form something new or am tryin to find some code example, I look at alot of pages. I wanted an easy way to bookmar, without tags and all that stuff. Like a stream of conciousness that si conected to my browsing!!
