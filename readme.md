Scrappy
=======
This is a simple bookmarking engine for my own stuff. It worked OK but needs alot more to it to make it searchable/functional.

The idea was to make it super quick to bookmark sites but also to scrape text from a page or an image. The website would then allow you to see all the "scraps"in a twitter like stream. 
When I use the web I open a lot of pages and if I am searching for something new or I am trying to find some code example, I look at even more. I wanted an easy way to bookmark, without tags and all that stuff. Like a stream of conciousness that is connected to my browsing!!
